React Hook Form Patterns
Quick Guide: Use register for native inputs, Controller for controlled components, useFieldArray for dynamic fields. Always provide useForm<FormData>() generics. Set mode: "onBlur" for optimal UX. Use resolver pattern for schema validation. Use useWatch instead of watch() in render to avoid re-rendering the whole form. Use field.id as key in useFieldArray -- never array index.

CRITICAL: Before Using This Skill
All code must follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md (kebab-case, named exports, import ordering, import type, named constants)

(You MUST provide generic types to useForm<FormData>() for type-safe form handling)

(You MUST use field.id as key prop in useFieldArray - NEVER use array index)

(You MUST use Controller for controlled components that don't expose a ref)

(You MUST use resolver pattern for schema validation - keep schemas separate from form logic)

(You MUST set mode: "onBlur" or mode: "onTouched" for optimal UX - avoid mode: "onChange" unless needed)

</critical_requirements>

Auto-detection: React Hook Form, useForm, register, handleSubmit, formState, Controller, useFieldArray, useWatch, useFormContext, resolver, zodResolver, FormProvider, useFormState, FormStateSubscribe

When to use:

Building forms with validation requirements
Managing complex form state with many fields
Creating dynamic forms with add/remove fields
Integrating with controlled component libraries
Handling multi-step or wizard forms
When NOT to use:

Single input without validation (use useState)
Server-only forms with server actions (use native form + action)
Read-only data display (not a form scenario)
Key patterns covered:

useForm hook with TypeScript generics
register vs Controller decision
useFieldArray for dynamic fields
Resolver integration for schema validation
useWatch and useFormState for performance
FormProvider/useFormContext for nested components
Form reset, async data loading, and values prop
FormStateSubscribe for targeted re-renders (v7.68+)
Philosophy
React Hook Form prioritizes performance through uncontrolled inputs and subscription-based updates. Only fields that change re-render, not the entire form. The library isolates form state from component state, minimizing re-renders and keeping forms responsive even with many fields.

Core Principles:

Uncontrolled by default - Use register for native inputs to avoid re-renders
Controlled when needed - Use Controller for UI library components that don't expose a ref
Schema validation via resolver - Separate validation logic from form logic
Subscription-based - Subscribe to only the form state you need (useWatch, useFormState)
Type safety - Always provide TypeScript generics for form data
Core Patterns
Pattern 1: Basic useForm with TypeScript
Always provide a type parameter, mode, and defaultValues. These three prevent the most common issues (no type safety, validation noise, undefined warnings).

const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
} = useForm<ContactFormData>({
  mode: "onBlur",
  defaultValues: { name: "", email: "", message: "" },
});
Why this matters: Without generics, field names are any. Without defaultValues, values are undefined and cause hydration mismatches. Without mode: "onBlur", the default "onSubmit" gives no feedback until first submit.

See examples/core.md for complete form with accessibility attributes and error display.

Pattern 2: Controller for Controlled Components
Use Controller when a component doesn't expose a native ref (custom selects, date pickers, rich text editors). Use register for standard HTML inputs.

<Controller
  name="service"
  control={control}
  rules={{ required: "Service is required" }}
  render={({ field, fieldState: { error } }) => (
    <>
      <Select {...field} options={serviceOptions} />
      {error && <span role="alert">{error.message}</span>}
    </>
  )}
/>
Key decision: If the component accepts a ref prop that forwards to a native input, register works. Otherwise, use Controller.

See examples/controlled-components.md for single select, date picker, and multi-select checkbox patterns.

Pattern 3: useFieldArray for Dynamic Fields
Use useFieldArray for repeatable field groups. Always use field.id as the React key -- array index causes state corruption on add/remove.

const { fields, append, remove } = useFieldArray({ control, name: "items" });

{fields.map((field, index) => (
  <div key={field.id}> {/* CRITICAL: field.id, never index */}
    <input {...register(`items.${index}.name`)} />
    <button type="button" onClick={() => remove(index)}>Remove</button>
  </div>
))}
Gotcha: append/prepend/insert require complete objects (not partial). Use rules.minLength on useFieldArray for minimum item validation. Array-level errors live at errors.items.root.

See examples/arrays.md for a complete invoice form with calculated totals.

Pattern 4: Resolver for Schema Validation
Use resolver to integrate validation schemas. The resolver handles validation; you wire it to the form. Keep schema definition separate from form code.

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";

const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  mode: "onBlur",
  defaultValues: { username: "", email: "" },
});
Why resolver over inline rules: Schemas are testable independently, reusable across forms, support cross-field validation (e.g. confirmPassword), and generate TypeScript types via z.infer.

See examples/validation.md for resolver integration with a registration form.

Pattern 5: useWatch for Reactive Derived Values
Use useWatch in a separate component to subscribe to specific fields without re-rendering the entire form. Prefer useWatch over watch() in render.

function PriceDisplay({ control }: { control: Control<PricingFormData> }) {
  const [plan, seats] = useWatch({ control, name: ["plan", "seats"] });
  return <div>Total: ${PLAN_PRICES[plan] * seats}</div>;
}
v7.61+ compute option: Transform watched values before subscription -- component only re-renders when the computed result changes.

const total = useWatch({
  control,
  compute: ({ plan, seats, billingCycle }) => {
    const base = PLAN_PRICES[plan] * seats;
    return billingCycle === "annual" ? base * 12 * (1 - ANNUAL_DISCOUNT) : base;
  },
});
See examples/v7-advanced.md Pattern 6 for complete compute example.

Pattern 6: useFormContext for Nested Components
Use FormProvider + useFormContext to share form methods across deeply nested components without prop drilling. Ideal for multi-section forms and wizard steps.

// Parent
<FormProvider {...methods}>
  <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
    <AddressFields prefix="shippingAddress" />
    <AddressFields prefix="billingAddress" />
  </form>
</FormProvider>

// Child - no props needed
function AddressFields({ prefix }) {
  const { register } = useFormContext<CheckoutFormData>();
  return <input {...register(`${prefix}.street`)} />;
}
When to use: 3+ levels of nesting or reusable form sections. For 1-2 levels, passing control/register as props is simpler.

See examples/wizard.md for a complete multi-step wizard using FormProvider with per-step validation via trigger().

Pattern 7: Form Reset and Async Data
Two approaches for loading external data into a form:

values prop (v7.x+, preferred): Reactively updates form when external data changes. Pair with resetOptions: { keepDirtyValues: true } to preserve user edits.

reset() in useEffect (legacy): Manually reset when data arrives. Use reset(data) which updates both values AND defaultValues for proper isDirty tracking.

// Modern: values prop (reactive, auto-updates)
useForm<FormData>({
  values: userData,
  resetOptions: { keepDirtyValues: true },
});

// Legacy: manual reset
useEffect(() => {
  if (data) reset(data);
}, [data, reset]);
Cancel/save pattern: reset() without args reverts to defaultValues. After save, call reset(data) to update defaultValues and clear isDirty.

See examples/v7-advanced.md Pattern 1 for values prop with async data.

Pattern 8: Isolated Error Display
Use useFormState with name to create error components that only re-render when their specific field's error changes. For v7.68+, FormStateSubscribe provides the same isolation as a component.

function FieldError<T extends FieldValues>({ control, name }: Props<T>) {
  const { errors } = useFormState({ control, name });
  const error = errors[name];
  if (!error) return null;
  return <span role="alert">{error.message as string}</span>;
}

RED FLAGS
High Priority Issues:

Using array index as key in useFieldArray -- causes state corruption on add/remove/reorder
Missing TypeScript generics on useForm -- loses type safety for field names and values
Using register for components that don't expose ref -- use Controller instead
Not providing defaultValues -- causes hydration mismatches and undefined warnings
Medium Priority Issues:

Using mode: "onChange" without reason -- validates on every keystroke, noisy UX
Destructuring many formState properties -- subscribes to all, causes unnecessary re-renders
Using watch() in render body -- triggers re-render on every field change; use useWatch instead
Calling setValue without shouldValidate: true -- may leave form in invalid state
Not using trigger(fieldNames) for step validation in wizard forms
Gotchas & Edge Cases:

reset() reverts to defaultValues; reset(newData) updates both values AND defaultValues
handleSubmit does not catch errors thrown in your onSubmit callback -- handle errors yourself with try/catch
append/prepend/insert require complete objects, not partial data
Array-level errors live at errors.arrayName.root, item errors at errors.arrayName[index].fieldName
shouldUnregister: true removes unmounted field values -- keep false (default) for wizard forms
useWatch returns defaultValue on first render before subscription kicks in
setValue does not directly update useFieldArray -- use replace() API instead
FormStateSubscribe works with control prop directly or via FormProvider (both are valid)
values prop (reactive external data) vs defaultValues (static initial values) -- do not mix their use cases

CRITICAL REMINDERS
All code must follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md

(You MUST provide generic types to useForm<FormData>() for type-safe form handling)

(You MUST use field.id as key prop in useFieldArray - NEVER use array index)

(You MUST use Controller for controlled components that don't expose a ref)

(You MUST use resolver pattern for schema validation - keep schemas separate from form logic)

(You MUST set mode: "onBlur" or mode: "onTouched" for optimal UX - avoid mode: "onChange" unless needed)

Failure to follow these rules will break form validation, cause re-render issues, and reduce type safety.
